A new version of [phraug](https://github.com/zygmuntz/phraug) with
improved command line arguments parsing, thanks to
[jofusa](https://github.com/jofusa).

This is a set of simple Python scripts for pre-processing large files,
things like splitting and format conversion. The names _phraug_ comes
from a great book, _Made to >>Stick_<<, by Chip and Dan Heath.

See [http://fastml.com/processing-large-files-line-by-
line/](http://fastml.com/processing-large-files-line-by-line/) for the
basic idea.

There's always at least one input file and usually one or more output
files. An input file always stays unchanged.
